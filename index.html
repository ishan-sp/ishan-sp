            <li><a href = "https://github.com/ishan-sp/aquaVision"><h3>AquaVision Image Classifier</h3></a>
                <h4>Tensorflow, OpenCV, Python, Google Colab </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implemented an image detection and classification model to detect 
                        floating debris/waste using live video stream.</li>
                    <li>A TFLite model was trained on a dataset of 400 images, and finetuned to 
                        improve confidence levels. The model used has a theoretical mAP of 22.2 
                        on the COCO standard.</li>
                    <li>The model can be deployed on edge devices.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a href = "https://github.com/ishan-sp/emergMgr"><h3>Emergency Response Manager</h3></a>
                <h4>C++, Python, Tkinter, REST API, VSCode </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Created an emergency responder dashboard for first responders. 
                        Functionality was provided for three personas to view and cater to 
                        emergency requests on a GUI. </li>
                    <li>Requests were processed in the C++ backend and the bridging link was 
                        achieved through REST API.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a href = "https://github.com/ishan-sp/rpiGasDetection"><h3>Gas Detection Platform </h3></a>
                <h4>Raspberry Pi, Python, Prometheus</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implemented a mobile gas detection platform facilitated by gas and 
                        temperature sensors. The vehicle could be controlled remotely via local 
                        Wi-Fi. Multiple sensors attached to the chassis provided real-time data on 
                        12 types of toxic gases and temperature levels.</li>
                    <li>The sensors were calibrated and operated using Python scripts running on 
                        a Raspberry Pi.</li>
                    <li>A web dashboard was created using Prometheus services.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
